<h2>Requirements</h2>
There are a few things you need right away in order to be successful in this course:

<ol>
  <li>The textbook - Basics of Web Design: HTML5 &amp; CSS3 by Terry Felke-Morris (ISBN-10: 0133128911 ). The assigned reading from the textbook explains most key concepts. This site will not repeat that information, only provide supplementary material.</li>

  <li>An editor with syntax highlighting, such as Brackets. While other editors will work, I would encourage you to use Brackets for this course. It runs a web server under the covers which will support some of the later topics such as custom fonts without requiring you to download and install a separate web server.</li>

  <li>A GitHub account. We will be working with git and GitHub to develop our projects throughout this course. Set yourself up with an account - I encourage you to use your actual name, then follow me (mbMosman), and email me with both your real name and account name. I will then add you to the course Organization so that you can access our team repositories.</li>

</ol>
